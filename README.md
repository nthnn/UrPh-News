# UrPh News
Minimalistic news outlet Android app.

## About the Project
Howdy! I've made this Android app that fetches updated and reliable news via [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/). It has an easy to understand UI (also available in night mode), its own search feature, and an in-app browser to read news articles.

## Post-Scriptum
- I didn't took time through the development. Potential users might find features that don't exist in this app.
- I made this hoping it would help to fight massive misinformation and fake news.
- This Android app is not monetized; thus, it contains no ads other than the 3rd party article providers.
- The app might not work properly in older versions of Android, such as Nougat, Marshmallow, Lollipop, KitKat, etc.
- This is not available on Google Playstore, since it doesn't accept my National ID. Lol.
- Lastly, updates might take a while.
